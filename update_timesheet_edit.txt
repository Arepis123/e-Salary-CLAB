Due to the large size of changes needed for timesheet-edit.blade.php, I'll create a summary document of changes that need to be applied. The changes are identical to those made in timesheet.blade.php:

1. Transaction Type Select (lines 204-207):
   - Add npl and allowance options

2. Amount Input (lines 211-214):
   - Add conditional for NPL days vs amount

3. Transaction List Display (lines 238-255):
   - Add badges for NPL and allowance
   - Show NPL as days with calculated amount
   - Show allowance with + prefix

4. Summary Section (lines 258-279):
   - Split into Earnings and Deductions
   - Calculate NPL amount from days
   - Show allowance total in green
   - Show NPL total in purple

Let me make these changes now...
